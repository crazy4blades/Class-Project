      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Founded in 1998 by a group of lifelong animal lovers and nutrition experts, SCP Wholesalers began with a simple
        mission: to deliver high-quality pet food to retailers across the country with unmatched reliability and care.
        What started as a regional operation based in St. Louis, Missouri, has grown into one of the nation’s leading
        pet food distributors, proudly serving thousands of retail partners from coast to coast.</p>
      <p>With over 500 employees working across our 50 distribution centers, SCP Wholesalers moves millions of pounds of
        premium pet food each year—supporting pet stores, veterinary clinics, shelters, and independent retailers alike.
        Our team is passionate not only about logistics but about animal health and well-being. That’s why every brand
        we carry is vetted for safety, nutrition, and quality.</p>
      <p>At SCP, we believe pets deserve the best, and so do our partners. We combine cutting-edge distribution
        technology with a personal, customer-first approach. Whether you’re a small neighborhood store or a large chain,
        our commitment is the same: reliable service, competitive pricing, and products pets love.</p>
      <p>As we look to the future, we continue to expand our product offerings, invest in sustainable packaging, and
        support animal welfare organizations nationwide. Because to us, wholesaling pet food isn’t just a business—it’s
        a way to make tails wag across America.</p>
